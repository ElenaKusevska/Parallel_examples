McKelvey makes a very interesting point in an old paper from the 1970's [1], showing that in a given space of social policies with a given number of voters, assuming that an individual's preference for a social policy is defined by a given utility function, it is possible to design a sequence of changes in social policy that will evolve a current equilibrium state into increasingly extreme policies. It is also possible to design a sequence of steps to evolve an initial, more moderate policy into a target policy that is more extreme. The proof is for the case of a utlity function defined through the euclidian norm. The implecations of this, if we consider the mathematical proofs as representative of social reality, are very disconcerting. But, that's not the point. The paper proposes an algorithm for this process that is nicely illustrated in the youtube video [2]. This is a fun algorithm to implement. And to try to run some simulations to see how it will perform.
